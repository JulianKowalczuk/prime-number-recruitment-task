# Prime Numbers Recruitment Task

Code is written in TypeScript using ESM. Base implementation was fixed, improved and splitted on smaller parts following single responsibility principle (SRP).

## Prepare

Run **npm i** to install required dependencies.

## Run

## Test

Vitest is used as tests framework. Unit and E2E tests should be separated, but for simplicity of code reviewing they are in same file.
Run using command **npm test**.
